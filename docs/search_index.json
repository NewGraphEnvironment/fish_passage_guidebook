This document is currently not even close to complete, extremely rough and likely contains errors. Please refer to provincial methods for data to be submitted to the province as our workflows are intended to complement these methods vs replace them. We have many online interactive reports that can illustrate how we use this data and they can be found in links at the top right corner of individual repositories that can be found here.

We need to do everything we can to look after ourselves and each other. Overall - some of the biggest things we can do is make sure people know where we are and when we are coming home, what communications are expected, we assess the hazards and minimize there risk. Having the right equipment is a huge part of that. You can find our detailed Health and Safety Plan here https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/hsp/. It changes all the time and those changes are reflected in our project specific safety plans and tailboard meetings. 2.1 Field Safety Plans Field safety plans are written up before traveling to any job site. An example of a somewhat recent plan can be found here http://www.newgraphenvironment.com/safety_plan_skeena_2023/ . Information included in these plans include: Check in and failed check in procedures. Who is watching our back and what communications need to happen for us to be considered safe. If those communications don’t happen what does the “back watcher” do about it! Location and contact info of field crew and check in person (including emergency contacts) as well as the accommodations where everyone is staying (as a back up to follow up if direct communications break down). Description of field crew vehicles so that people can go looking for the crew with that info if they don’t show up when/where they are supposed to. Personal and crew equipment checklists. Location and contact info of nearest hospital. A brief description of the job, as well as map links and a list of possible locations where crew members will visit. 2.2 Check-in Procedures and Field Communications Call, text or in reach emergency contact each morning to share the plan for the day (i.e. name of roads and sites). Agree on a regular daily check in time and report position/provide updates. Agree on a final time that people need to check in by and what happens if they don’t. Often we group text to our check in person before we leave accommodations in the morning with our general pla. Example below: 8:00 am - “we are working up Morice-Owen FSR all day (electrofgishing and habitat confirmation walks) and will be without cell. This are is west of Houston. We will check in early afternoon with the satellite communicator.”). 1:00 pm - we are electrofishing at site 12345 located at km25 of the Fern Creek FSR accessed off of the Morice-Owen. All is good. We may be a bit late getting home. 5:00 pm - we are on our way home. We will check in when we get back to the accommodations. It might be a bit after our 7:00pm hard check-in deadline so don’t worry. We should be back before 8 for sure. 7:15 pm - we are both home safe! Thank you. Have a great night! 2.3 Safety Gear The following provides a list of safety gear that we commonly carry as well as key equipment that is part of our standard field equipment for fish passage work (ie. fish passage assessments, fish habitat confirmations, follow up monitoring, electrofishing, drone surveys, etc.). This table can be filtered and exported for your own use. readr::read_csv( url((&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NewGraphEnvironment/new_graphiti/main/assets/data/equipment.csv&quot;) ) )|&gt; # filter(!is.na(eq_pers_standard)) |&gt; select(eq_item:eq_task3) |&gt; # remove &quot;all&quot; for now select(-eq_task1) |&gt; # rename purrr::set_names(c(&quot;item&quot;, &quot;personal_standard&quot;, &quot;truck&quot;, &quot;safety&quot;, &quot;electrofishing&quot;, &quot;fish_passage&quot;)) |&gt; # still need to replace all values with x (one liner with dplyr function i believe) mutate(across(where(is.character) &amp; !item, ~ ifelse(. != &quot;&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, .))) |&gt; my_dt_table(cols_freeze_left = 0) 2.4 Tailboards Tailboard meetings are a way to reset at the start of new work tasks to put safety first as the top priority at all places of work. Our tailboard template is unique in that it contains documentation of numerous safety policy actions in one place. Tailboards help us identify hazards so we can mitigated their risk and communicate about past experience where we learned how to avoid injuries. A copy of our tailboard can be found here https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/hsp/blob/master/data/form_templates/tailboard_template.pdf and some of the key components are as follows: Site Assessments, Hazard Identifications and Risk Assessments Worker Assessments Personal Protective Equipment Checklist/Inspections Machinery Inspection (Vehicle/Trailer/ATV) Emergency Contact List and Info Call In/Call Out Numbers for Check-ins Hazard Inspections First Aid Assessments 2.5 Emergency response plans Similar to how we make a field safety plan for each job site, we also make an emergency response plan so that all crew members and staff know what to do in case of an emergency. It important that everyone has reviewed this plan and knows where it is stored in case it needs to be reviewed. Our emergency plan template can be found here https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/hsp/blob/master/data/form_templates/ERP_template.pdf. Information included in these plans include: Names and contacts for all crew members Emergency contacts Location of nearest hospital Evacuation assembly location Evacuation route Location of fire extinguisher and spill kit Procedures for fire response, natural disasters, spills, and injuries Remote site emergency call-in procedures 2.6 Fieldwork checklist Here are somethings to check before heading out into the field: Field safety plans complete. Ensure you have all the correct PPE and equipment for the fieldwork. Charge hand radios. Charge inreach/zoleo. Check the fire information for the study area here Ensure your vehicle is in safe working condition. "],["data-collection-and-field-navigation.html", "3 Data Collection and Field Navigation 3.1 Fish passage assessment methods 3.2 Mergin Maps 3.3 Phone and battery management 3.4 Backup Maps for Field Navigation", " 3 Data Collection and Field Navigation 3.1 Fish passage assessment methods In the field, crossings are assessed for fish passage following the procedures outlined in Field Assessment for Determining Fish Passage Status of Closed Bottomed Structures (BC Ministry of Environment 2011). There is a link to these methods in the digital field form so you can easily access them while in the field if you have cell service. There is a field form for this work that can and should be used to collect data in the field as well. As our digital field data collection system is still in development, we are currently minimally populating a paper form as well as the digital form. We collect more detailed comments and other information on the digital field forms but still rapidly fill out a paper form to ensure we have the data in case of a digital failure. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/fieldwork/methods_mobile.jpg&quot;) Figure 3.1: The methods used for fish passage assessments can be found in the ‘Form PSCIS’ under ‘Methods’ 3.2 Mergin Maps Mergin Maps is a geodata platform that allows us to collaborate with others by collecting data in the field and syncing to a shared QGIS project (MerginMaps 2023). Check out the Mergin Maps documentation for more information. We use Mergin Maps on our phones to locate sites, understand watershed/land values and collect data through digital field forms (adapted versions of the Field Assessment for Determining Fish Passage Status of Closed Bottomed Structures (BC Ministry of Environment 2011). Once downloaded to a phone - wifi or cell service is not required to view maps and collect data. Also of note - it is not required to have the project downloaded on a laptop to see/use them on the phone - only a Mergin account with access to the newgraph workspace is necessary. 3.2.1 Set up Setting up Mergin Maps on a phone requires a wifi or cell connection: Download the Mergin Maps app from the App Store (Apple) or Google Play (Android) following the instructions here. Sign up for a “free trial” account. We suggest a username with no spaces (or special characters like %$&amp;) such as “mwmt_isharpe” as it tells us a lot just by the name. If you have already made a username for github and it has no spaces or special characters perhaps you just want to use that one. Sign in if you have an existing account. It will require you to make a FREE trial workspace. Once this is complete you will be able to access the newgraph workspace at no cost (even beyond the end of the free trial period). We will receive an invitation to join the newgraph Mergin workspace. Switch to the newgraph workspace following these instructions. 3.2.2 Using Mergin on a mobile device Although use in the field does not require wifi or cell service, there are actions that require an internet connection such as switching accounts, downloading projects from the cloud, synchronising changes to the cloud, and displaying online background maps (ex. google imagery). Use the following instructions to download your projects before you head out into the field! Navigate to the Projects tab following the instructions here. Download the project you want to view. You will need at least 2GB of storage on your phone to download a project. Once downloaded, tap the project name to open. View the different themes available. View the available layers. You will only see one layer visible, bcfishpass Mobile, which contains all our layers grouped into categories. Click bcfishpass Mobile to view the categories, such as Crossings, Forms, Project Specific. Some category contains sub-categories, so have a look around to see all the available layers. Toggle a layer to turn it on of off on the map. For example, if I want to make the streams_st layer visible, I would navigate through bcfishpass Mobile → Streams → Habitat models→ streams_st to toggle on streams_st. Know how to exit a Project. 3.2.3 Field Data Entry into Mergin Follow the instructions to add a feature to a specific layer and the guidance below to add fish passage assessment data to the project: Ensure you are at the location of the culvert before adding the feature to Form PSCIS. Tap record at the bottom of the screen. Once the form appears you can enter the data. The form is divided into sections which you can see at the top of the screen. The Stream and Climate sections will only become visible if you have selected closed bottom structure for the crossing type because only closed bottom structures require that information. Navigate through each section to enter data. Click the green check mark in the top right corner to save the feature. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/fieldwork/more_sections.jpg&quot;) Figure 3.2: The Stream and Climate sections will only become visible if you have selected closed bottom structure for the crossing type While entering information save the form often as glitches can occur which can lead to loosing work. When you are no longer offline, make sure to sync your changes! to the online shared project. When adding features (sites) to the project map, here are some things to take note of: We find that Mergin works much better (faster rendering) with airplane mode on. In addition to using the digital field forms (see above section), make sure to fill out the paper copies as well as in the past we have seen uncommon issues with syncing and data corruption. Switching between themes can be very useful for seeing different levels of detail in the field. Some of the common themes we use are: ADD COMMON THEMES!! The site_id is important: If a site has a PSCIS ID then that is used as the identifier. If there is no PSCIS ID we use the “Crossing - Modelled ID” (a.k.a “My Crossing Reference”) as the “Modelled ID”. If there is neither (rare but usually occurs when a stream is not mapped) we use a numeric ID based on the date (YYYYMMDD01 - example 2023070502 - would be our second assessment for the day). If there is an associatedchris_culvert_id (“MoTi” identifier) we include that as well. Always collect the all the information, including the photos, so that we have what we need. If you don’t collect some information then write in the assessment comments why it is missing. For example, if you cannot see the inlet of the culvert, take a picture of what you can see and upload it to Mergin then explain in the assessment comments that the inlet was not visible. Same with fields you are not sure of, fill everything out and put details in the assessment comments of what is going on. It’s important that each of the photos uploaded be different, using the same photo for more than one section (ex. Outlet photo and Barrel Photo) creates data management issues. 3.2.4 Assessment Comments It’s important to write detailed comments in the `Assessment Comments” section of the form. Comments should include everything that will helps characterize the site and justify the habitat ratings given by the surveyor. Some example are: justification for habitat value rating (ex. good flow and some gravels present) the condition of the culvert/crossing observations of riparian health or deterioration and potential causes (cattle, erosion, stream velocity, etc) Size, number and species (if known) of fish observed location of the crossing if it was incorrectly mapped reasons for photos taken are not ideal (ex. water too high to see the inlet so it is not clear in the photo) 3.2.5 Photos Photos are one of the most important pieces of data we collect with the majority of which loaded to our digital field forms. The Timestamp Camera app is used to take photos (landscape only) in the field. Ensure the current date and time and UTM coordinates are in top right corner using the settings in Figure 3.3, take the photos on the camera first - then load to the field form after (for backup). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/fieldwork/timestamp_settings_access.jpg&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/fieldwork/timestamp_settings.JPG&quot;) Figure 3.3: Left: Navigate to the Timestamp settings by pressing the ‘clock’ icon in the bottom right corner. Right: Timestamp UTM and time display settings. Photos are taken at surveyed crossings and all SIX of the following images are always required: road, crossing inlet, crossing outlet, crossing barrel, channel downstream and channel upstream of the crossing (Figure 3.3). Take photos on the camera first then add to the digital field form in the photos sections following the instructions below: 2. Navigate to the Photos section of the digital field form 3. You will see a place to add each photo under the correct name (Ex: Road photo, Barrel Photo, etc) 4. Add photosFrom Gallery 5. Do not use the same photo for more than one section (Ex: Upstream photo and Inlet Photo) because this creates data management issues. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/fieldwork/photos_mobile.jpg&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/fieldwork/crossing_all.JPG&quot;) Figure 3.4: Left: Under the correct heading (Road photo, Barrel Photo, etc), add each photo ‘From Gallery’ in the photos section of the digital field form, Right:Examples of six required pohtos. From top left clockwise: Road/Site Card, Barrel, Outlet, Downstream, Upstream, Inlet. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/fieldwork/photos_mobile.jpg&quot;) Below are some tips for taking proper photos: Use the TimeStamp app with the correct settings and ALWAYS orient camera landscape when taking photos. This is because of the way the photos are processed for reporting. The first photo you take should always be of the road with the site_id on the site card visible in the corner (or a photo of site card filled in with site name, date, stream name). This allows sorting of photos based on site for all photos transfered from the phone to the cloud or hardrive. Include something for scale. We use ski poles for safety navigating in slippery uneven streambeds and to measure depth so one of the poles can be used for scale in the photos. This can come in very handy for understanding stream and crossing structure characteristics just by reviewing the photos. It is important to let the App “find” where you are before taking the first photos at a new site. It can take a few seconds for the app to zoom into the location where you are standing once it is opened. Closing the app every time you use it will help your phone battery not drain. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/fieldwork/crossing_all.JPG&quot;) Ensuring photos are stored and backed up appropriately in case anything goes wrong is very important. We store photos in 3 places: On your phone in your photos app In Mergin on the digital field forms for each site as explained above On a cloud based service such as icloud or google photos, etc. You will likely have to pay for more storage to handle all the photos. Make sure you sync your photos to the cloud when are are back in service. Photos should also be taken of the paper field forms at the end of the day. 3.3 Phone and battery management Your phone needs to be mounted on a secure mount on the dash of your vehicle so you can see the phone while driving. Always plug in your phone when driving so it can charge. Always carry an external battery pack so that you can charge your phone if it dies. Ensure your phone is in a quality case. Make sure you have enough storage available to take lots of photos! 3.4 Backup Maps for Field Navigation We want to get the job done no matter what. In many areas that we work we have backup pdf maps that allow us to navigate to sites regardless of whether Mergin is operational or not (usually is but every once in a while technical challenges can occur). If pdf maps are available for a watershed group they are located at https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/ . The maps are organized by watershed group code (ex. BULK is the Bulkley River watershed group, and KISP is the Kispiox River watershed group) In order to navigate using our pdf maps we use Avenza Maps is key for loading georeferenced pdf field maps from &lt;&gt;. We also add kml files of our target sites (taken from safety plans) to Avenza to make navigation easy. The paid version is necessary to load many maps at the same time for big projects. In order to get the pdf maps from the Hillcrest server to our phones we use Dropbox. The maps are first downloaded to dropbox - then loaded to the phone through the dropbox app. # 4. [Garmin BaseCamp](https://www.garmin.com/en-CA/software/basecamp/) is used to move `gpx` files in and out of our gps. We export tracks out of `Basemap` with the track names unchanged and we name the `gpx` files informatively (see screenshot below for example). **Note: The gps units have a little \\$150 micro sd card behind the batteries that can come loose, this chip is key to knowing where we are going. Be careful when changing batteries.** "],["planning-for-the-field.html", "4 Planning for the Field 4.1 Mergin Maps on your computer 4.2 Background planning", " 4 Planning for the Field We use QGIS and Mergin Maps for our fish passage preparation, data management and analysis. QGIS (Quantum Geographic Information System) is a free, open-source software that allows users to create, edit, visualize, analyze, and publish geospatial information (QGIS Development Team 2009). Mergin Maps is a geodata platform that allows us to collaborate with others by collecting data in the field and syncing to a shared QGIS project (MerginMaps 2023). Check out the Mergin Maps documentation for more information. Before heading out into the field, we research the area we will be going to by visualizing the area on QGIS. We want to understand all we can about a site before arriving there. Our QGIS projects include an extensive amount of information that can be relevant for a site, such as information regarding: Land ownership Past fish observations The conditions of the crossing structure Links to relevant reports How to access sites Habitat models Road tenure information This section will get you started with all our field preparation procedures. 4.1 Mergin Maps on your computer Map creation, research, planning, and data QA takes place using QGIS and Mergin Maps on our computers. 4.1.1 Set up Set up QGIS on your computer: Follow this link to the QGIS Download Page to install the latest version. Here is some great info for getting up to speed with the basics of QGIS. Set up Mergin Maps with QGIS on your laptop: Follow the instruction to sign up for a free mergin account. Make sure you have the latest version of QGIS installed. Install the Mergin Maps plugin. We will send you an invitation to join the newgraph Mergin workspace. 4.1.2 View projects in QGIS Switch to the newgraph workspace in QGIS following these instructions. Our project will show up in the Mergin Maps tab of the Browser window. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/planning/mergin_projects.png&quot;) Figure 4.1: Viewing New Graph’s Mergin projects Right click the project name and select Download. Save the project somewhere appropriate. For New Graph employees this should be Projects/gis. Double click or right click to open the project. 4.1.3 Common actions in QGIS Below are some common actions we use in QGIS. Most of the time we will have the attributes table open for a layer and will be navigating to features from there, you can find lots of information about working with attributes tables here. We use themes to simplifying viewing projects. You can select a theme by clicking the “eye” icon in Layers panel. You can also add themes following the instructions here. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/planning/themes.png&quot;) Figure 4.2: How select themes in QGIS Open the attributes table, and doc it so it is visible on the same screen as the map using the icon below. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/planning/doc_attributes.png&quot;) Figure 4.3: Select the ‘doc attributes table’ icon on the top right of the attributes table so it is visible on the same screen as the map Zoom to a feature from the attributes table by selecting the feature row in the table and then clicking Zoom to feature located at the top of the attributes table. This will zoom to the feature on the map and highlight it in yellow. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/planning/zoom_attributes.png&quot;) Figure 4.4: Zoom to a feature from the attributes table Finding a feature such as a culvert, stream, or else anything on the map.

Forms are available for many layer but we have created special categorized forms for the form_pscis and form_fiss_site layers because these are the layers we add data (sites) to. Select one of these layers, use the Identify Results tool to pull up the crossing’s information, then click the form icon located in the top left corner of the Identify Results panel. A new window will pop up with the form. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/planning/forms.png&quot;) Figure 4.9: How to view the digital field form for either the form_pscis or form_fiss_site layers Measure a distance by selecting the ‘ruler’ icon located on the top right, then click two points to measure the distance between. A new window will pop up to show the distances. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/planning/measure.png&quot;) Figure 4.10: How to the distance between two points You can view photos from a previously assessed PSCIS site in QGIS by selecting the Crossings - PSCIS assessment layer, using the Identify Results tool to pull up the crossing’s information, then clicking the link from the image_view_url field. It will then direct you to a web-page with the site photos. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/planning/link_photos.png&quot;) Figure 4.11: Access photos from a previously assessed PSCIS crossing 4.1.4 Editing a Feature If for some reason you need to add or edit features (this doesn’t happen that often), you can do so by following the instructions here. Make sure to sync the project following these instructions before to ensure that you have the most up to date version of the project (others may have edited the project since you last opened it) and after so that other team members will see to your updates. 4.2 Background planning Before heading out into the field, we research the area we will be going to by visualizing the area on QGIS. We want to understand all we can about a site before arriving there. Here are some things to investigate for a site, with the corresponding layer on QGIS: All Crossings - PSCIS layers - Has the crossing been assessed before? What was it ranked as? Are there other crossings upstream or downstream and have they been assessed? Land Ownership- who owns the land. Is the crossing on private land, is it even accessible? bcfishobs FISS fish observations- have there been fish observed upstream or downstream in the past? FISS obstacles- are there barriers to fish passage noted on the stream? habitat models- is the stream modeled at suitable habitat for the target species? What type of habitat is upstream/downstream? Use layers within Basemap section Google Satellite, Bing Aerial- is there a stream or crossing present? How will you access the crossing? Which roads will you take? How far of a walk will it be from your vehicle to the crossing (use measuring tool on QGIS) "],["references.html", "References", " References BC Ministry of Environment. 2011.
