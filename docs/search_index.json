We need to do everything we can to look after ourselves and each other. Overall - some of the biggest things we can do is make sure people know where we are and when we are coming home, what communications are expected, we assess the hazzards and minimize there risk. Having the right equipment is a huge part of that. You can find our detailed Health and Safety Plan here https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/hsp/. It changes all the time and those changes are reflected in our project specific safety plans and tailboard meetings. 2.1 Field Safety Plans Field safety plans are written up before traveling to any job site. An example of a somewhat recent plan can be foudn here http://www.newgraphenvironment.com/safety_plan_skeena_2023/ . Information included in these plans include Check in and failed check in procedures. Who is watching our back and what communications need to happen for us to be considered safe. If those communications don’t happen what does the “back watcher” do about it! Location and contact info of field crew and check in person (including emergency contacts) as well as the accommodations where everyone is staying (as a back up to follow up if direct communications break down). Description of field crew vehicles so that people can go looking for the crew with that info if they don’t show up when/where they are supposed to. Personal and crew equipment checklists. Location and contact info of nearest hospital. A brief description of the job, as well as map links and a list of possible locations where crew members will visit. 2.2 Check-in Procedures and Field Communications Call, text or in reach emergency contact each morning to share the plan for the day (i.e. name of roads and sites). Agree on a regular daily check in time and report position/provide updates. Agree on a final time that people need to check in by and what happens if they don’t. Often we group text to our check in person before we leave accommodations in the morning with our general pla. Example below: 8:00 am - “we are working up Morice-Owen FSR all day (electrofgishing and habitat confirmation walks) and will be without cell. This are is west of Houston. We will check in early afternoon with the satellite communicator.”). 1:00 pm - we are electrofishing at site 12345 located at km25 of the Fern Creek FSR accessed off of the Morice-Owen. All is good. We may be a bit late getting home. 5:00 pm - we are on our way home. We will check in when we get back to the accommodations. It might be a bit after our 7:00pm hard check-in deadline so don’t worry. We should be back before 8 for sure. 7:15 pm - we are both home safe! Thank you. Have a great night! 2.3 Safety Gear The following provides a list of safety gear that we commonly carry as well as key equipment that is part of our standard field equipment for fish passage work (ie. fish passage assessments, fish habitat confirmations, follow up monitoring, electrofishing, drone surveys, etc.). readr::read_csv( url((&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NewGraphEnvironment/new_graphiti/main/assets/data/equipment.csv&quot;) ) )|&gt; # filter(!is.na(eq_pers_standard)) |&gt; select(eq_item:eq_task3) |&gt; # remove &quot;all&quot; for now select(-eq_task1) |&gt; # still need to replace all values with x (one liner with dplyr funciton i believe) purrr::set_names(c(&quot;item&quot;, &quot;personal_standard&quot;, &quot;truck&quot;, &quot;safety&quot;, &quot;electrofishing&quot;, &quot;fish_passage&quot;)) |&gt; my_dt_table(cols_freeze_left = 0) 2.4 Tailboards Tailboard meetings are a way to reset at the start of new work tasks to put safety first as the top priority at all places of work. Our tailboard template is unique in that it contains documentation of numerous safety policy actions in one place. Tailboards help us identify hazzards so we can mitigated their risk and communicate about past experience where we learned how to avoid injuries. A copy of our tailboard can be found here https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/hsp/blob/master/data/form_templates/tailboard_template.pdf and some of the key components are as follows: Site Assessments, Hazard Identifications and Risk Assessments Worker Assessments Personal Protective Equipment Checklist/Inspections Machinery Inspection (Vehicle/Trailer/ATV) Emergency Contact List and Info Call In/Call Out Numbers for Check-ins Hazard Inspections First Aid Assessments 2.5 Fieldwork checklist Here are somethings to check before heading out into the field: Field safety plans complete. Ensure you have all the correct PPE and equipment for the fieldwork. Charge hand radios. Charge inreach/zoleo. Check the fire information for the study area here "],["data-collection-and-field-navigation.html", "3 Data Collection and Field Navigation 3.1 Apps and Programs Used 3.2 Mergin Maps 3.3 Fish passage assessment methods 3.4 Photos 3.5 Phone and battery management", " 3 Data Collection and Field Navigation When in the field, we use Mergin Maps on our phones to visual the area, but also to add data to the map through digital field forms. This allows us to locate upstream and downstream features such as crossings, barriers, and fish observation. We can also use it to determine the type of surrounding habitat and land use, as well as what type of habitat the stream is modeled as in bcfishpass(Norris [2020] 2024). Mergin Maps is a geodata platform that allows us to collaborate with others by collecting data in the field and syncing to a shared QGIS project (MerginMaps 2023). Check out the Mergin Maps documentation for more information. 3.1 Apps and Programs Used Timestamp Camera is used to take photos (landscape only) in the field. Ensure the current date and time and UTM coordinates are in top right corner using the settings below. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/fieldwork/timestamp.png&quot;) Figure 3.1: Timestamp settings Avenza Maps is key for loading georeferenced pdf field maps from https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/fishpassage/projects/. We also add kml files of our target sites (taken from safety plans) to Avenza to make navigation easy. The paid version is necessary to load many maps at the same time for big projects. Dropbox is used for bulk uploads to Avenza. Garmin BaseCamp is used to move gpx files in and out of our gps. We export tracks out of Basemap with the track names unchanged and we name the gpx files informatively (see screenshot below for example). Note: The gps units have a little $150 micro sd card behind the batteries that can come loose, this chip is key to knowing where we are going. Be careful when changing batteries. 3.2 Mergin Maps Mergin is handy because we don’t need wifi or cell service to view the maps. You don’t need to have the project downloaded on your laptops to see/use them on your phone, you just need to have a Mergin account with access to the newgraph workspace. 3.2.1 Set up Set up Mergin Maps on your phone. This must be done with wifi or while in cell range (not offline): Download the Mergin Maps app from the App Store (Apple) or Google Play (Android) following the instructions here. You don’t need to have the project on your laptops to see/use on your phone. Sign up for a “free trial” account. We suggest a username with no spaces (or special characters like %$&amp;) such as “mwmt_isharpe” as it tells us a lot just by the name. If you have already made a username for github and it has no spaces or special characters perhaps you just want to use that one. Sign in if you have an existing account. It will require you to make a trial workspace, once this is complete you will be able to access the newgraph workspace at no cost (even beyond the free trial period). We will send you an invitation to join the newgraph Mergin workspace. Switch to the newgraph workspace following these instructions. 3.2.2 Using Mergin on your mobile device Mergin is great because we can use it in the field without wifi or cell service. However, there are some actions that require internet connection and cannot be done offline, such as switching accounts, downloading projects from the cloud, synchronising changes to the cloud, or displaying online background maps. Use the following instructions to download your projects before you head out into the field! Navigate to the Projects tab following the instructions here. Download the project you want to view. You will need at least 2GB of storage on your phone to download a project. Once downloaded, tap the project name to open. View the different themes available. View the available layers. You will only see one layer visible, bcfishpass Mobile, which contains all our layers grouped into categories. Click bcfishpass Mobile to view the categories, such as Crossings, Forms, Project Specific. Some category contains sub-categories, so have a look around to see all the available layers. Toggle a layer to turn it on of off on the map. For example, if I want to make the streams_st layer visible, I would navigate through bcfishpass Mobile → Streams → Habitat models→ streams_st to toggle on streams_st. Know how to exit a Project. 3.2.3 Field Data Entry into Mergin We have digital field forms through Mergin Maps that allow you to add features and data to the map while in the field. Most of the time we don’t have service, so we just save our Projects often and then once back in service we sync with the cloud. Follow the instructions below to add a feature (site) to the project map: Follow the instructions add a feature. Ensure you are adding the feature to the correct layer, most likely Form PSCIS or Form FISS Site. Then tap record at the bottom of the screen. Next, a form will appear and you can enter the data. The form is divided into sections which you can see at the top of the screen. Navigate through each section to enter data. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/mapping/features_mobile.PNG&quot;) Figure 3.2: Features form is divided into sections at the top of the screen Save the forms as often as possible so if it glitches or fails you don’t lose your work. When you are no longer offline, make sure to sync your changes! When adding features (sites) to the project map, here are some things to take note of: We find that Mergin works much better (faster rendering) with airplane mode on. In addition to using the digital field forms (see above section), make sure to fill out the paper copies as well because over the last year we have seen uncommon issues with syncing and data corruption. Switching between themes can be very useful for seeing different levels of detail in the field. Some of the commong themes we use are: ADD COMMON THEMESE!! The site_id is important: If a site has a PSCIS ID then that is used as the identifier. If there is no PSCIS ID we use the “Crossing - Modelled ID” (a.k.a “My Crossing Reference”) as the “Modelled ID”. If there is neither (rare but usually occurs when a stream is not mapped) we use a numeric ID based on the date (YYYYMMDD01 - example 2023070502 - would be our second assessment for today). If there is an associatedchris_culvert_id (“MoTi” identifier) we include that as well. 3.3 Fish passage assessment methods In the field, crossings are assessed for fish passage following the procedures outlined in “Field Assessment for Determining Fish Passage Status of Closed Bottomed Structures” (BC Ministry of Environment 2011). All data should be entered using the digital field forms in Mergin Maps. Please see Field Data Entry into Mergin for how to enter data into Mergin. Photos are taken at surveyed crossings and when possible included images of the road, crossing inlet, crossing outlet, crossing barrel, channel downstream and channel upstream of the crossing and any other relevant features, in that order. See Photos for how to take proper photos. The following information should be recorded and entered into Mergin Maps for all surveyed crossings. The list below is an example of what information is included in the digital field forms in Mergin: date of inspection crossing reference crew member initials Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates stream name road name and kilometer road tenure information crossing type crossing subtype culvert diameter or span for OBS (Open Bottom Structure) culvert length or width for OBS A more detailed “full assessment” should be completed for all closed bottom structures and included the following parameters: presence/absence of continuous culvert embedment (yes/no) average depth of embedment whether or not the culvert bed resembled the native stream bed presence of and percentage backwatering fill depth outlet drop outlet pool depth inlet drop culvert slope average downstream channel width stream slope presence/absence of beaver activity presence/absence of fish at time of survey type of valley fill habitat value rating Habitat value ratings are based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), fish migration patterns, the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation (Table 3.1). fpr_table_habvalue %&gt;% knitr::kable(caption = &#39;Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011).&#39;, booktabs = T) %&gt;% kableExtra::column_spec(column = 1, width_min = &#39;1.5in&#39;) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling(c(&quot;condensed&quot;), full_width = T, font_size = font_set) Table 3.1: Table 3.2: Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011). Habitat Value Fish Habitat Criteria High The presence of high value spawning or rearing habitat (e.g., locations with abundance of suitably sized gravels, deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris) which are critical to the fish population. Medium Important migration corridor. Presence of suitable spawning habitat. Habitat with moderate rearing potential for the fish species present. Low No suitable spawning habitat, and habitat with low rearing potential (e.g., locations without deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris, and with little or no suitably sized spawning gravels for the fish species present). 3.4 Photos Taking proper photos is important for visualizing the site, data QA, and the quality of our report. See the Apps and Programs Used sections to download the TimeStamp app. Below are some tips for taking proper photos: Use the TimeStamp app Ensure the current time and UTM coordinates in top right corner, see settings in Apps and Programs Used for how to set this up. See photo below for proper coordinates. Orient camera landscape when taking photos. The first photo you take should always be of the road with the site_id on the site card visible in the corner (or a photo of site card filled in with site name, date, stream name) so that it is easy/possible to know which photos come from where. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/fieldwork/road_photo.png&quot;) Figure 3.3: The first photo should always of the road with the site_id on the site card visible in the corner It is important to let the App “find” where you are before taking the first photos at a new site. It can take a few seconds for the app to zoom into the location where you are standing once it is opened. Closing the app every time you use it will help your phone battery not drain. 3.5 Phone and battery management Your phone needs to be mounted on a secure mount on the dash of your vehicle so you can see the phone while driving. Always plug in your phone when driving so it can charge. Always carry an external battery pack so that you can charge your phone if it dies. Ensure your phone is in a quality case. Need some sort of cloud backup so that photos sync to the cloud each night. they are on phone AND in mergin. At end of day take photos in order of all field pages "],["mapping.html", "4 Mapping 4.1 Mergin Maps on your computer", " 4 Mapping We use QGIS, and Mergin Maps for our fish passage data management and analysis. Before heading out into the field, we research the area we will be going to by visualizing the area on QGIS. QGIS (Quantum Geographic Information System) is a free, open-source software that allows users to create, edit, visualize, analyze, and publish geospatial information (QGIS Development Team 2009). Mergin Maps is a geodata platform that allows us to collaborate with others by collecting data in the field and syncing to a shared QGIS project (MerginMaps 2023). Check out the Mergin Maps documentation for more information. This section will get you started with all our mapping procedures. 4.1 Mergin Maps on your computer Map creation, research, planning, and data QA takes place using QGIS and Mergin Maps on our computers. 4.1.1 Set up Set up QGIS on your computer: Follow this link to the QGIS Download Page to install the latest version. Here is some great info for getting up to speed with the basics of QGIS. Set up Mergin Maps with QGIS on your laptop: Follow the instruction to sign up for a free mergin account. Make sure you have the latest version of QGIS installed. Install the Mergin Maps plugin. We will send you an invitation to join the newgraph Mergin workspace. 4.1.2 View projects in QGIS Switch to the newgraph workspace in QGIS following these instructions. Our project will show up in the Mergin Maps tab of the Browser window. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/mapping/mergin_projects.png&quot;) Figure 4.1: Viewing New Graph’s Mergin projects Right click the project name and select Download. Save the project somewhere appropriate. For New Graph employees this should be Projects/gis. Double click or right click to open the project. 4.1.3 Common actions in QGIS Below are some common actions we use in QGIS: We use themes to simplifying viewing projects. You can select a theme by clicking the “eye” icon in Layers panel. You can also add themes following the instructions here. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/mapping/themes.png&quot;) Figure 4.2: How select themes in QGIS Finding a feature such as a culvert, stream, or else anything on the map. Use Select feature by value. Then input your search term and select zoom to feature, for example, looking for the site with site_id = 15600301. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/mapping/finding_feature.png&quot;) Figure 4.3: How to finding features in QGIS knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/mapping/site_search.png&quot;) Figure 4.4: How to finding features in QGIS Getting information about a feature (“Identify Feature”).
